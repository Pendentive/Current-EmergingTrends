# Current-EmergingTrends

##Project summary and given code
The objective of the pirate puzzle was to design and implement an agent using a Deep Q-learning Neural Network (DQN) , the pirate, which could find an optimal path to the treasure. The pirate must avoid the walls and occupied spaces, and minimize the number of steps taken in route to the treasure. 

Given Code:
- Necessary library imports
- Maze array matrix (layout of puzzle encoded as a matrix)
- (show) Maze display function
- Direction encoding
- (play_game) Function for playing the game
- (completion_check) Function for validating the maze can be completed
- (build_model) Method for creating a model to be trained
- Default limits and variable initializations within training function (qtrain)
- Time functions for measuring time during training

## Created code
- DQN training algorithm (Within qtrain function)
- Epsilon Greedy algorithm and parameter tuning

## Computer scientists and their responsibilities
Computer scientists integrate knowledge from varying industries and fields into machine discernable languages. As the world must rely on non-animal entities, machines, to progress and support our growing needs and pioneering spirit, computer scientists carry an increasingly heavy burden moving forward; Machines and the software used must be ethical in creation, action, and implication. 

In my work as a computer scientist, I have learned to further incorporate logical, mathematics and bottom-up thinking into my work. For the pirate puzzle, the DQN agent was not excessively difficult to implement, but was difficult to implement under the assumption others may have to understand what was done or needed to later modify the code. In creating self-commenting code, commented code, and code formatted for understanding, not only can the code be understood and tested by those outside of machine learning (ML) fields, but my thought processes and procedures can be gleaned and critiqued. 

Ethics are integrated into much of a computer scientistsâ€™ daily life and decisions. As all software ends at a user somewhere along its path, and with the advent of ML, ethical programming must be implemented at increasing lower software levels. Higher level methods, bias, prevention and moderation, federated computing, and data privacy, must be considered as important as low-level methods such as zero trust security and encrypted computing.
